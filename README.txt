# README COGNITIVE PREDICTIVE MAPS DURING BEHAVIOUR AND REPLAYS

These scripts were used for the simulations in the paper "Learning predictive cognitive maps with spiking neurons during behavior and replays", Elife, 2023.

# CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

1. use "conda env create -f environment.yml" to create a conda env with all required packages to run the code. Alternatively, install the required packages in "environment.yml" manually.

2. Activate the virtual env.

# RUN A SIMULATION

1. Set the hyperparameters to use in configuration dictionary (bottom of the script)

2. Run "python3 [filename.py]"

# NOTE

1. Scripts for figure 5 do not follow the above structure, just run the script itself.
